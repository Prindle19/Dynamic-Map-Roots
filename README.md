This project will demonstrate parsing a JSONP response of the Maps Engine Directory, and allow a user to
chose a Map to View from Public and Private maps.

It will then parse the MapRoot JSONP and dynamically create all the MapDataLayers needed to view that map in the Google Maps v3 API.

This is the completed version of the project.
